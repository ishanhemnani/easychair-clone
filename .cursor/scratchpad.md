# Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a full-stack conference management web app (MVP) similar to EasyChair, supporting core academic conference workflows. The MVP will enable user authentication, conference setup, paper submission, reviewer assignment, review and rebuttal phases, basic communication, and analytics. The stack is Next.js (frontend), Express.js (backend), PostgreSQL (via Supabase), JWT-based auth, and Tailwind CSS.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Designing a flexible data model for users, conferences, papers, reviews, and assignments
- Implementing secure, role-based authentication and authorization
- Handling file uploads (PDF/ZIP) efficiently and securely
- Managing reviewer assignment, preferences, and conflicts (basic logic)
- Supporting a rebuttal phase with clear state transitions
- Mocking email communication for MVP
- Providing useful analytics and dashboards for admins
- Ensuring a clean, intuitive UI/UX for all roles

# Lessons

- Express.js 5.x has compatibility issues with path-to-regexp. Use Express.js 4.18.2 for stability.
- Port 5000 is often used by macOS ControlCenter. Use port 5001 or higher for development servers.
- Always run `npm audit fix` after installing dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- Include health check endpoints for easy server status verification.
- Use bcryptjs for password hashing with salt rounds for security.
- Implement JWT token verification in middleware for protected routes.
- Create reusable role-based middleware functions for different access levels.
- Use React Context for global authentication state management.
- Store JWT tokens in localStorage with proper error handling for expired/invalid tokens.
- Implement comprehensive file upload validation (type, size, security).
- Use UUID primary keys for better security and scalability.
- Create mock systems for MVP development to avoid external dependencies.
- Implement proper error handling and validation at all API endpoints.
- Use database transactions for data consistency in complex operations.
- Design role-based access control from the beginning for security.

## Milestone: Implementing Manage Conferences
- Starting implementation of the admin conference management feature (list, create, edit, delete conferences).
